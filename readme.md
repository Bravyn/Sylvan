# NeuroDash

## Objective:
Help the main character, Neuron Nate, navigate through the brain and collect neurotransmitters while avoiding obstacles and challenges.

### Gameplay:
1. Characters: You play as Neuron Nate, a lively neuron with a mission to gather neurotransmitters and keep the brain running smoothly.

2. Brain Maze: The game takes place in a colorful and dynamic brain maze, filled with pathways, synapses, and obstacles.

3. Collect Neurotransmitters: Your goal is to collect as many neurotransmitter icons scattered throughout the maze. Each neurotransmitter collected earns you points and helps keep the brain's communication in check.

4. Avoid Obstacles: Watch out for obstacles such as misfiring neurons, toxic chemicals, or blocked synapses. Colliding with these obstacles slows you down or deducts points.

5. Power-Ups: Along the way, you can collect power-ups like "Speed Boost" to enhance Neuron Nate's agility or "Shield" to protect against obstacles for a limited time.

6. Time Pressure: As you progress, the game speed increases, challenging your reflexes and decision-making abilities. Quick thinking and agile maneuvers are key to success.

7. Leaderboards: Compete against other players globally or with friends on online leaderboards to see who can achieve the highest score and become the ultimate Neurotransmitter Dash champion.

8. Educational Insights: Between game levels, provide fun facts about different neurotransmitters, their functions, and their impact on the brain. This adds an educational element to the game, making it both entertaining and informative.

Remember, the main goal of the game is to have fun while learning about neurotransmitters and the brain's intricate communication system. So, put on your gaming hat, dodge those obstacles, and collect those neurotransmitters to become a master of Neurotransmitter Dash!
